# Data-Pagination-and-Filtering-Project
The data file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Used my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students. 
 Used technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page. Added a search bar to allow user to look for a specific student.
